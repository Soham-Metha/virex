# VIREX : Virtual Execution Console

**VIREX** (**VIR**tual **EX**ecuter) is a platform-independent virtual machine designed around a flexible intermediate language called **SASM** (Simulated Assembly). It’s inspired by the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**, but unlike JVM bytecode, SASM is **open, readable, and writable** — you can program directly in it.

## 🚀 What is SASM?

Just like Java compiles to bytecode for the JVM, any language can be compiled into SASM for VIREX. The difference is:

- SASM is **assembly-like**, human-readable, and editable.
- SASM is **open**, letting anyone build tools and languages around it.

You can even create your own programming language that compiles into SASM and runs anywhere VIREX runs — making your language instantly portable.

## 🧠 Why SASM?

- Learn how **assembly-level code** works through a clean and simplified syntax.
- Build a **compiler** without worrying about machine-level code generation.
- Make your own language **platform-independent** by targeting SASM.

## 🛠 Current Features

- ✅ **VS Code syntax highlighter** for SASM
- 🌲 **AST visualizer** for seeing how your SASM code is parsed and compiled
- 🔧 A new programming language called **ORIN** is currently under development. It is being designed to compile directly to SASM.

## 🧪 Getting Started (LINUX)

1. **Clone this repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Soham-Metha/virex.git
   cd virex/
   ```
2. **Build the project (requires `sudo`):**
   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```
3. **Run an example program:**

   ```bash
   cd ./examples/SASM/
   virex
   ```

   > If the **TUI doesn't render properly**, try adjusting your **terminal font size**.

   > If that doesn't help, you can tweak layout values in **src/VM/vm_tui.c::CreateWindows()**.
   > The constants used are defined as **percentages** of the screen dimensions.

   > P.S. **kitty terminal** config, and font used, are available in `/tools`

4. **Inside VIREX, do the following:**

- Select **"Run SASM/ORIN command with custom flags"**
- Enter the following command:
  ```bash
  -i helloWorld.sasm -I ./ -o tmp.sm
  ```
  > ⌨️ use **Arrow keys** for navigation in menu.
- Select **"SASM build and exec"** by pressing **'a'**
- Enter the output filename (`tmp.sm`)

5. **Activate the syntax highlighter in VS Code**

- Open VS Code
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + P`
- Type: `Preferences: Color Theme`
- Select: `Palenight+sasm`
  > 🎨 Open any `.sasm` file in vs code to see the syntax highlighter at work!
