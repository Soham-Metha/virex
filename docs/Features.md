### **Syntax Highlighting:**

![Image](../assets/vs_theme.png)

To make coding in SASM more comfortable and developer-friendly, weâ€™ve created a custom VS Code theme tailored specifically for the syntax of our language. This theme highlights key constructs, registers, operands, and labels, making it much easier to read and debug code at a glance.

âœ¨ Install the theme by using our [install script](Getting-Started#highlight-on-linux).

### **AST:**

An AST visualizer that helps better understand the sequence flow
of any program!

!!! info "Local/Global Scopes"

    Each Code Block in the visualized AST represents a Scope, Block 0 being global scope.

## ðŸ›  Under Development

- ðŸ”§ A new programming language called **ORIN** is currently under development. It is being designed to compile directly to SASM.

> If you're interested in compilers, language design, or virtual machines â€” **contributions are very welcome**!
