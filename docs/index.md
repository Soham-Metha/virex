**VIREX** (VIRtual EXecuter) is a platform-independent virtual machine designed around a flexible intermediate language called **SASM** (Simulated Assembly). Itâ€™s inspired by the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**, but unlike JVM bytecode, SASM is **open, readable, and writable** â€” you can program directly in it.

## ðŸš€ What is SASM?

Just like Java compiles to bytecode for the JVM, any language can be compiled into SASM for VIREX. The difference is:

- SASM is **assembly-like**, human-readable, and editable.
- SASM is **open**, letting anyone build tools and languages around it.

You can even create your own programming language that compiles into SASM and runs anywhere VIREX runs â€” making your language instantly portable.

## ðŸ§  Why SASM?

- Learn how **assembly-level code** works through a clean and simplified syntax.
- Build a **compiler** without worrying about machine-level code generation.
- Make your own language **platform-independent** by targeting SASM.
