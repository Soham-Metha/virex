ðŸ§  Register Set (VIREX VM)

The VIREX virtual machine provides a fixed set of general-purpose and special-purpose registers, each designed to support specific roles such as execution flow, memory management, I/O, or control signaling.

Although some registers are named with specialized roles, as of version 0.5.0, only a few instructions implicitly expect specific registers. This means that in most cases, registers can be used flexibly as general-purpose storage without restriction.

!!! info ""

    Registers are internally identified by integer IDs.<br>
    During assembly, the compile-time functions ref() and val() are used to indicate register intent, whether a reference (address) or value should be used.

    - By default, registers are interpreted as references (ref()).
    - Instructions like SETR and GETR explicitly **require register references**, not values.
