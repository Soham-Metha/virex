### ðŸ§  VM Calls (VIREX Runtime Interface)

Similar to how **syscalls** allow user programs to interact with the operating system, **vmcalls** are a mechanism for communicating with the virtual machine itself. These instructions trigger **built-in functionality** provided by VIREX at runtime.

Currently, **8** vmcalls are defined and implemented, handling tasks like memory management, printing, and i/o. There is also an idea under consideration to support external [plugin-based]() vmcalls.

!!! info ""

    VM calls are executed via a specific opcode [INVOKE](../reference/missing.md) followed by the call number. A simple header file can also be created to map the vm calls to their IDs.
