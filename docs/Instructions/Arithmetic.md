## âž• Arithmetic

This section describes the available arithmetic **opcodes/mnemonics** and their corresponding operations.

> All arithmetic instructions accept **only a single operand**.  
> The **other operand**, as well as the **destination**, is taken from one of the **Link registers**:  
> `L0`, `L1`, `L2`, `L3`.

## ðŸ”¢ Addition

The following opcodes are used for **addition**:

- `ADDI` â€” Add Signed Integer
- `ADDU` â€” Add Unsigned Integer
- `ADDF` â€” Add Floating Point

---

### ðŸ”¹ ADDI â€” *Add Signed Integer*

- **Opcode**: `13`
- **Operand Accepted**: 64-bit signed integer
- **Operation**:
  Adds the operand to the value in **register L2**.  
  The result is **stored back in L2**.

??? example "Example: ADDI"
    ```sasm
    ADDI 1  ; Adds 1 to the current value in L2
    ```

> L2 is treated as a 64-bit signed integer for this operation.

## Arithmetic

This section describes the available arithmetic opcodes/memonics and their corresponding operations.

All the arithmetic instructions accept only a single operand.
The other operand(also the destination) is taken from the Link register L0, L1, L2, L3

SEE {REFERENCE}

### REFERENCE NEEDED `registers-Link_registers`

### Addition

The addition instructions are
    - ADDI (ADD Integer)
    - ADDU (ADD Unsigned)
    - ADDF (ADD Floating point values)

1. ADDI:
    Opcode: 13
    Operand Accepted: 64-bit signed integers
    Adds the passed 64-bit signed int value to the value stored in the register L2(also considered to be an 64-bit signed integer value)
    The result is stored in the L2 Register

!!! Example

    ADDI 1 ;Will add 1 to whatever value is in register L2
