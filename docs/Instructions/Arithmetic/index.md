This section describes the available arithmetic **opcodes/mnemonics** and their corresponding operations.

> All arithmetic instructions accept **only a single operand**.  
> The **other operand**, as well as the **destination**, is taken from one of the **Link registers**:  
> `L0`, `L1`, `L2`, `L3`.
