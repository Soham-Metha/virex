### ðŸ§  Compile-Time Functions (CTFs)

Compile-Time Functions (CTFs) are evaluated during the **assembly phase** rather than at runtime. They assist the assembler in interpreting operand intent, reserving memory, and handling static analysis like string length resolution.

These functions help enrich the assembly language with limited expression capabilities while keeping runtime execution lightweight.
